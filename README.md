CryptographyDemo.py

This program demonstrates symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography. The program is divided into two parts. The first part displays symmetric key cryptography by using the Python cryptography library to encrypt a message, displaying the encrypted message to the user, then decrypting the encrypted message and displaying it. The second part of the program uses asymmetric key encryption by using the RSA Python library to generate a public and a private key, encrypting the message using the public key, and then decrypting the message using the private key.
